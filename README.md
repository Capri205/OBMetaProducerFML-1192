# OBMetaProducerFML-1192

Minecraft Forge 1.19.2 mod to gather meta data for use by external tools, utilities and monitoring.
Outputs player position data every 5 seconds for use with player markers on our Overviewer maps for example.

This is very specific to our needs and setup so of not much value to anyone out there I would think.

Compiled for Forge/Minecraft 1.19.2 using Java 17
